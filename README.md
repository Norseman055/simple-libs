# simple-libs
A collection of C++ generic classes I use to abstract away design patterns I want to use for my programs.

Unless in a folder or otherwise specified, each set of classes are meant to be modular and need nothing more than to include the header file in your project. A simple explanation of how the class is to be used will be associated with each folder, as well as all other necessary generics to use with it. Please direct any thoughts or comments to connor.mahoney.52@gmail.com with a subject of "GitHub: Generic Libraries" and I'll see what I can do about addressing them or fixing any issues!
